- **flex-start**: Aligns the flex item at the start of the cross axis.
- **flex-end**: Aligns the flex item at the end of the cross axis.
- **center**: Centers the flex item along the cross axis.
- **baseline**: Aligns the flex item such that its baseline aligns with other flex items.
- **stretch**: Stretches the flex item to fill the cross axis.
- **start**: Aligns the flex item at the start of the cross axis, ignoring the flex container's align-items value.
- **end**: Aligns the flex item at the end of the cross axis, ignoring the flex container's align-items value.
